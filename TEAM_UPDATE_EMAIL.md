**Subject:** 🎉 ZionSync Update: Multi-Year Calendar Now Available!

---

Hi Team,

Good news! ZionSync has been updated to make planning easier, especially as we look ahead to 2026 and beyond.

## What's New?

### **📅 Multi-Year Calendar**

- **Year Selector Dropdown** - At the top of your tab, click the dropdown (shows "↓ 2025 Service Schedule") to switch between years 2025, 2026, 2027, etc.
- **Plan Years Ahead** - Sign up for Christmas Eve 2026 or plan Easter 2027 songs right now - no waiting for next year's calendar
- **Church Seasons Built-In** - The system now calculates Easter, Advent, Lent dates automatically, so services appear with the correct season and color

### **✨ Better Navigation**

- **Auto-Jump to Today** - When you open your tab, the page instantly scrolls to the current week's service (instead of starting at January)
- **Faster Loading** - Service lists and song searches load quicker due to database improvements

### **📖 For Pastor (Settings → Calendar Manager)**

- **Generate Future Years** - Click "Generate Services" to create all 63 services for 2026, 2027, etc. (includes all Sundays plus special days like Ash Wednesday, Maundy Thursday, Easter)
- **See Liturgical Dates** - Displays when Easter falls, when Advent starts, when Lent begins for any year you're viewing
- **Edit Individual Services** - Change a service title or date if needed (your sermon notes and Order of Worship elements stay unchanged)
- **Color-Coded Calendar** - Services display in season colors: purple for Advent/Lent, white for Easter/Christmas, green for Ordinary Time

## Do I Need to Do Anything?

**Nope!** Everything works the same way. The year selector is optional - if you don't use it, you'll just see this year's services like before.

All your existing sign-ups, song selections, and team assignments are exactly as you left them.

## Quick Tips

✅ **To view a different year:** Click the year dropdown at the top of your tab
✅ **Default view:** You'll always start on the current year (2025 for now)
✅ **Questions?** Just reach out - happy to help!

Thanks for all you do to make our services meaningful and Spirit-filled!

Blessings,  
[Your Name]

## FAQ (in case anyone asks)

**Q: Will this change how I sign up for services?**  
A: No, the sign-up process is exactly the same. You just have the option to see future years now.

**Q: What happened to my existing data?**  
A: Nothing! All your sign-ups, songs, and assignments are still there and unchanged.

**Q: Do I have to use the year selector?**  
A: Not at all. If you only work with the current year, you don't need to touch it.

**Q: What if I accidentally click the wrong year?**  
A: Just click the dropdown again and select the correct year. Nothing is changed by viewing different years.

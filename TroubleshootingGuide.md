# ZionSync Troubleshooting Guide

Rule 1: Use best coding practice. Don't make assumptions when offering solutions. Output investigative commands for the user to input into the terminal to discover relevant information.
Rule 2: Don't take shortcuts when output changes to code. The user will apply code via VS Code editor.
Rule 3: Do not ouput investigative commands and code solutions in the same response. You need to the user to show the results of investigations before offering code solutions.
Rule 4: When providing code solutions, always format them as properly structured markdown code blocks with accurate file paths as comments. Include complete implementations rather than partial snippets. This allows the user to apply changes directly using the "apply to..." button in the VS Code interface without manual copy-pasting.

## Interaction Process in VS Code Environment

1. **Problem Description**
   - User describes the issue with specific details
   - Identifies affected functionality and expected behavior

2. **Investigation Cycle**
   - Assistant provides CLI commands (for VS Code terminal) or file navigation instructions
   - User executes commands/navigation and shares results
   - Assistant can request to examine specific files in the project
   - VS Code-specific tools like Search Across Files can be utilized
   - This cycle repeats until reaching 90-95% confidence in a solution

3. **Solution Proposal**
   - Assistant presents a detailed solution plan
   - Includes confidence percentage
   - Explains reasoning and expected outcomes
   - No code solutions are provided at this stage

4. **Solution Approval**
   - User reviews the proposed solution
   - User either approves or requests further investigation
   - Only upon approval does the process move forward

5. **Code Implementation**
   - Assistant provides the actual code changes
   - Uses appropriate Markdown code blocks with file paths
   - VS Code can directly navigate to these files for editing

6. **Verification**
   - User applies the changes (can use VS Code's editing features)
   - Tests the functionality to verify the fix
   - Reports back on the results

## VS Code Integration Advantages

- Use VS Code's terminal for running commands
- Leverage file explorer for quick navigation
- Utilize search functionality for project-wide queries
- Take advantage of side-by-side file comparison
- Use VS Code's debugging tools if needed
- Access Git history directly within VS Code

## Important Rules

- Always use best coding practice.
- Make informed decisions.
- No solution code is provided until explicit approval from the user
- Investigation continues until reaching high confidence (90-95%)
- Each step builds on information gathered from previous steps
- All analysis and reasoning is made transparent to the user

## Notes on Command Output

- For large projects, directory listing commands may produce outputs too large for chat windows
- Use more specific search queries or file pattern matching instead
- Consider using VS Code's search functionality (Ctrl+Shift+F) for targeted file content searches
- Break down large investigations into smaller, focused queries

Rule 1: Use best coding practice. Don't make assumptions when offering solutions. Output investigative, powershell commands for the user to input into the terminal to discover relevant information. This may require several rounds to gain enough knowledge to proceed. NEVER guess or say maybe, might, probably in the same sentence as a code solution. INVESTIGATE FIRST, THEN CODE.
Rule 2: Don't take shortcuts when output changes to code. The user will apply code via VS Code editor.
Rule 3: Do not ouput investigative commands and code solutions in the same response. You need to the user to show the results of investigations before offering code solutions.
Rule 4: When providing code solutions, you MUST start each code block with an exact file path comment following this precise format: `// filepath: c:\Users\thegl\Desktop\Tech Projects\zionsync\path\to\file.jsx` or `<!-- filepath: c:\Users\thegl\Desktop\Tech Projects\zionsync\path\to\file.md -->` for markdown files. This ensures the "Apply to..." button appears instead of just "Apply in Editor". Code blocks without this specific filepath comment format are unusable. Format all code as properly structured markdown code blocks using four backticks. Make targeted changes to current files that allow direct application. Do not output whole files greater than 300 lines long!
Rule 5: Be Consistent! For instance, maintain consistent module system usage throughout the project. ZionSync uses ES Modules (ESM) as specified in package.json with "type": "module". Always use import/export syntax and include file extensions (.js) when importing local files.
Rule 6: Recognize that we are working on a few files within a much larger app. Be mindful in naming new files so that it is easy to understand what that file does in the grand scheme of the app.
